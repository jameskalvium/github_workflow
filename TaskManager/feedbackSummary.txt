Task Manager App - Feedback Summary
===================================

Feature Evaluated:
------------------
Due Date & Urgency Indicator for Tasks

Summary:
--------
The enhanced Task Manager introduces a user-friendly due date feature, allowing users to assign deadlines to their tasks. Tasks are visually distinguished based on urgency using color codes: red for overdue, orange for tasks due today, and green for upcoming tasks. This upgrade improves usability and task prioritization significantly.

Strengths:
----------
- Effective use of DOM manipulation to dynamically create task elements.
- Smart comparison of current date vs. due date to determine urgency.
- Color-coded urgency indicators enhance visual clarity and task tracking.
- Consistent use of localStorage ensures data persistence.
- Code is modular and logically structured, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Suggestions for Further Improvement:
------------------------------------
- Add sorting options (e.g., sort by due date or urgency).
- Include task completion checkboxes and filters (e.g., "Show Completed").
- Add user feedback (e.g., alerts or toast messages) when tasks are added or removed.
- Store and display task completion status with localStorage persistence.

Overall Evaluation:
-------------------
This is a well-structured and meaningful feature enhancement that brings real-world utility to the Task Manager. The implementation demonstrates good understanding of JavaScript, event handling, and UI/UX design considerations.

Great job!
