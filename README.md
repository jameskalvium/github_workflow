# 🎮 2D Multiplayer Trivia Game

We're building a real-time, multiplayer trivia game where players race to answer questions and rack up points. The goal? Deliver a fully playable version by the end of the sprint—complete with working multiplayer rooms and the core gameplay experience.

---

## ✅ What We're Aiming to Deliver:
- 🧠 Real-time trivia questions with live scoring  
- 📊 Scoreboard that updates as players play, and a 🏆 winner announcement at the end  
- 🖥️ A clean start screen and 📋 clear instructions  
- 🕹️ A working multiplayer lobby (either via sockets or shared sessions)  
- 🎨 Visual polish with assets and styling for a smooth, engaging experience  

---

## 🚫 What We’re Skipping (For Now):
- ❌ No user login or authentication  
- 🎭 No custom avatars  
- 📉 No advanced leaderboard or player stats

## 🗓️ Milestones & Timeline

We’ve aligned our roadmap with our learning units, so we grow while we build. Here's our rough game plan:

- ✅ Define project scope (✓ that’s this!)  
- 🔧 Kick off GitHub repo & branch flow  
- 🧩 Plan components and structure (with a little help from Copilot)  
- ❓ Build question logic & scoring system  
- 🔗 Get the multiplayer room up and running  
- 🎮 Aim for a playable version — early demo ready  
- ✨ Add polish: animations, sound, and responsive UI  
- 🐞 Refactor, squash bugs, and tighten the logic  
- 🧼 Final UI/UX cleanup  
- 📝 Wrap it up: write README, notes, and demo prep
